## About The Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, available at [creeper32767.github.io](https://creeper32767.github.io). It serves as a central hub to showcase my projects, share my thoughts on technology and literature, and provide useful web-based tools.

The site is designed with a focus on performance and user experience, utilizing modern web standards and Fluent Design principles.

*   **Web Tools Collection:** A suite of browser-based utilities:
    *   **Color Converter:** A tool for manipulating and converting color formats.
    *   **Fluent Code Editor:** A lightweight code editor built with CodeMirror.
    *   **Reader Card Generator:** Create beautiful, shareable cards for book quotes using Fluent Design.
    *   **Snapshot Generator:** A utility for capturing webpage snapshots.
*   **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
